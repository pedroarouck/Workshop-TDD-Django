Important
================
This repository contains code and tutorials used to lead a Test-driven Django workshop. These were developed by `San Diego Python`_ and used for a full-day event where anyone interested can come and learn `Django`_.

My goal is to increase the reach of this material. To do so, I will translate the workshop into Brazilian Portuguese and update the code to work with the latest tool versions.

You can see the original version of the tutorials available at http://test-driven-django-development.readthedocs.org.

If you want to discuss this material and contact San Diego Python, feel free to join them on Discord at https://discord.gg/8GpWuVvdbQ.

Check also the excellent  `Django tutorials`_, it is best if users go through the tutorials and understand the absolute basics
of Django before the workshop.

Thank you for the support!
